## Module 0 Whole Tile Triggering ##

Investigating the whole tile triggering problem associated with the Module 0 detector at LBNL.

This repository functions as the current codebase for investigating the whole tile triggering problem associated with the Module 0 detector at LBNL. The current physical candidates causing these occurences include but are not limited to: 

* High energy electromagnetic showers
* Sync pulses being generated at 1 Hz

To run the driver code of the investigation:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `python3 main.py --datalog_file={datalog file} --geometry_file={tile layout file}`, where you can download a [datalog file](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/dune/data/Module0/TPC1+2/dataRuns/evdData/) (it is currently optimal to download any file > 200Mb) and a [tile layout file](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/dune/data/Module0/) (current version: `multi_tile_layout-2.1.16.yaml`)

### Current Project Roadmap ###

- [X] Implement a suite of selection algorithms to tag interesting events
    - [X] Look for events with 'nhit' > threshold for a given tile
    - [X] Find pulses within interesting events, generate useful statistics
    - [X] use scipy.spatial.ConvexHull to find the pulse area

- [] Determine the origin of the whole tile triggering problem
    - [] Is there a spatial/temporal pattern to these hits?
    - [] Does this pattern relate to the hydra network geometry?
    - [] ...

- [] Possibly implement the pulse finding algorithm as part of the event building
    - [] Are there particular widths/thresholds of interest?
    - [] Other potentially useful statistics? 
    - [] Add a 'pulses' group to the HDF5 files
    - [] ...

### Upcoming implementations ###

* Refinement of parameter values for
    1. threshold for number of hits per tile per event
    2. maximum pulse width with respect to 'sliding' charge window
* More plotting utilities (3D functionality, etc)
* Implementing more indicators for whole tile triggering identification
* More documentation

### File documentation ###

- `configuration.py`: Handles tile layout information directly from passed `.yaml` file 

- `selection.py`: Obtains information from a passed datalog file
  If a cut on the number of hits per tile per event is specified, a dictionary is returned that is formatted as:
  ```
    {evid_1: {tile_id_1: nhits_1, tile_id_2: nhits_2, ...},
     evid_2: {tile_id_1: nhits_1, ...}
     ...
    }
    ```
The events that satisfy the cut will be utilized to find potential pulses, a short burst of large amounts of charge in a short amount of time distributed on a tile. 

- `pulse_finder.py`: Finds pulses from specified events is made from the dictionary obtained by `selection.py`. The pulse finding algorithm attempts to find pulses based on the amount of charge deposited on a tile for a given time slot. 

The implementation of an Instile (*IN*formation *S*torage of a *TILE* ==> pronounced 'In-still') enables easier pulse data storage, including their associated charge windows, start/end times, lists needed for histogram plotting, etc., as well as making it easier for additional things to keep track of to potentially be added in the future (e.g. list of hit id's) 

The algorithm implements sixteen Instiles whose charge windows will simultaneously iterate in time scanning each tile for pulses within a specific time slice. The current criteria for a pulse is the following:

1. charge threshold: 1000 * 10^3 e
2. time window: 5 * 0.1 microseconds
3. number of pulses found on an individual tile: 8 (to eliminate potential 'sync pulses')

If these criteria are satisfied, then the pulses are stored in a finalized dictionary outputted at the end for future analysis. Each instile is stored according to its tile number in a dictionary:
```
    {1: (Instile for tile 1),
     2: (Instile for tile 2),
     ...
    }
```
which is how an Instile's information will be updated throughout the pulse finding process. If a pulse is a WTT pulse and not a sync pulse, it will be stored in `complete_pulses`, a dictionary that will keep track of WTT pulses. Once an event is completely iterated through, `complete_pulses` will be stored in `event_pulses`, a dictionary that stores all of the pulses occuring in an event, which will look something like:

```
    {evid_1: {tile_id_1: Instile,
            tile_id_2: Instile,
            ...},
     evid_2: {tile_id_3: Instile,
             tile_id_4: Instile,
             ...},
     ...
    }
```
This will be useful when plotting utility functions are utilized in the post-processing stage of the codebase.

- `instile.py`: Class file for an Instile

- `display_pulses`: Plotting utilities for pulses (currently function based)

- `tile_plot.py`: Plotting functionality

- `main.py`: Main driver function 

- `module0_evd.py`: Event display script created by LBNL scientists.
